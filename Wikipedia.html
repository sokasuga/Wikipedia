        <b>Mercerism</b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English">(/mɜːsərɪzᵊm/)</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">religion</a> 
        centered around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophy</a> of a charismatic figure named Wilber Mercer. It was started by a group of
        people post-world nuclear war who set out to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_religious_groups">major religion</a> with the main philosophy of the importance of empathy towards living things, specifically
        other humans and animals. Followers of Mercer, also called Mercerites, practice Mercerism by using a device called the <a href="https://bladerunner.fandom.com/wiki/Empathy_box">empathy box</a> to physically 
        and spiritually fuse with Mercer (as well as other humans), who undergoes an endless ritualistic climb up hill, enduring the pain of being hit with stones. By doing this people validated their empathy.

        Empathy boxes were placed all over the world by the Founders along with a message to “only kill the killers”. When clutching the handles, 
        the Mercerite would be transported to a drab hill, merged with Mercer. As Mercer endures a symbolic uphill struggle, bombarded with rocks, 
        individuals collectively feel the associated pain and suffering. Mercer's suffering is a central tenet of the religion,  
        and followers connect with him through an empathy box — a device that allows shared emotional experiences. This connection 
        is not only a religious act but also a form of communal empathy that binds individuals in a shared emotional experience. However, this could 
        result in injury in real life or in some cases, especially among elders, death. All individuals merge with Mercer and each other at the same 
        time, leading people who go in feeling happy to come out feeling less happy and vise versa.

        After the nuclear world war, people fell into a great sense of depression and hopelessness. Reflecting on how the major religions
        of the past, a group of people going by the title Founders took it upon themselves to create a new religion
        in order to help these people. There was disarray and confusion with the rise of hyper realistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(robot)">andorids</a>, 
        so they provided a line to be able to sort them (empathy). With a lot of people living far away from each other, due to reasons 
        such as social standing or nomad status, there was a lack of sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community">community</a>. 
        To resolve this, the Founders created a device called an empathy box that would give users <a href="https://bladerunner.fandom.com/wiki/Hallucinogens">hallucinogens</a> and sent out a clip of an 
        unknown actor climbing up a hill on a soundstage. When using this device people get the sense they were being merged with Mercer 
        and everybody else and feels their emotions. Which in turn makes people feel like they’re a part of a community
        feel connected to others, as well as affirming their empathy skills. Due to this, Mercerism became a major religion
        in a short amount of time that was so widely practiced that not having an empathy box
        was actually deemed strange. So many people believed in it so hard that it caused a group hallucination that manifested physical 
        reactions and sightings of Mercer. In 2021, the host of the popular TV show Buster Friendly exposed Mercer for being a simulation. 
        People were shocked by this but continued to use empathy box because whether Mercer was real or not didn’t matter as long as it served the purpose the Founders made it for.

      <h2>Inspirations</h2>
      <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(142, 142, 142);background-color:#858585;">
      <section id="Inspirations">
        Mercerism contains lots of inspiration from Evangelical Christianity. The Founders’ backstory of the Mercer as someone who had special powers that led to the Killers arresting him and labeling him as a freak.
        During an attempt to get away from them, he accidently stumbles into tomb world where he was stuck until he ascended again. The way of practicing this religion is for followers fuse with Mercer as he is in an endless cycle of being hit by stones. 
        A lot of elements are cleary inspired by what Jesus went through in the bible. Jesus was also bombarded by a group of people due to his power(the roman soliders in this case) which led him to his death on the cross, until be resurrected again. 
        He suffered for and with his followers aswell. The Founders made these parallels because Christianity served a simliar effect as what they were trying to achieve with Mercerism. They found humans, as social creatures, had an innate desire to 
        connect with others and feel there’s a bigger purpose and meaning in their world. Christianity provided community and a purpose/meaning to Christians' life and by also having a Martyr figure with such experiences, Mercerism has the same effect.

        Mercer's focus on empathy is endorsed in the attempts to retire rogue androids by being considered the main distinguishing trait 
        between androids and humans.
